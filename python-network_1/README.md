Requirements
Python Scripts
Recommended editors: Visual studio code
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if __name__ == "__main__":)
